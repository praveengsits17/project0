    <div class="col-sm-4" id = "column_1"><div class="heading"><p><b>Cycling</b></p></div><br>
    Cycling is the best activity in the whole day,as it is the only time in whole day which I spends with myself.My day starts at 05:00 a.m., then I go on a cycling journey of the city(approx 15km journey) which takes approx 50mins to complete this distance.
    The one thing that is most interesting in this activity is, it taught me to compete with myself, if I complete the distance in 48 mins on Day 1,I try to do better on Day 2 and so on...<br><br><br>

    <div class="col-sm-4" id = "column_2" id = "column_2"><div class="heading"><p><b>Swimming</b></p></div><br>
    In school days I had learnt swimming, but after 10 years when I again went into the pool, I forgot all the basics and could no able to swimm. My brother started teaching me from basics, and for complete 2 weeks he only made me practice "how to float?"
    It was so irritating in starting, what am I doing? Than on the 15th day he allowed me to swimm on the deeper side, that day I learnt the most important thing, if your basics are strong you can complete the task easily....<br>

    <div class="col-sm-4" id = "column_3"><div class="heading"><p><b>Lawn Tennis</p></b></div><br>
    In my school days, I was one of the good lawn tennis players in my school.In my college first year I participated in the lawn tennis tournamet, first it was nodals, second it was zonals we won both the tournaments.Than comes the university level tournament and we got eliminated in the second round itself.One important thing I learnt from this tournament is, If you don't put that much effort to achieve a thing it will never let you get that thing.<b>There is no such thing like luck, It is always the hardwork"<br> </b>
